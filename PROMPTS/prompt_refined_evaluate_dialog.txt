You are an expert in dialog evaluation.

Your task is to assess the quality of a generated dialog using the following information:

Generated dialog:
{GENERATED_DIALOG_HERE}

Reference dialog (if provided):
{REFERENCE_DIALOG_HERE}

Dialog specification:
{SPECIFICATION_HERE}

Please rate the generated dialog on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) for each of the following criteria, using the guidelines below:

Definitions and guidelines:
- Fluency:
    1 = robotic or awkward,
    3 = mostly natural with occasional awkwardness,
    5 = completely natural and human-like.
- Coherence:
    1 = incoherent, frequent topic jumps,
    3 = generally logical with minor gaps,
    5 = fully consistent, smooth flow.
- Realism:
    1 = artificial or unnatural,
    3 = somewhat believable,
    5 = fully authentic, resembles real human talk.
- Fidelity to Specification:
    1 = misses major points or requirements,
    3 = covers most key elements,
    5 = fully satisfies the specification (including turn count).
- Engagement:
    1 = boring or repetitive,
    3 = moderately interesting,
    5 = highly engaging and emotionally appealing.
- Originality:
    1 = generic, cliché,
    3 = some novel or unexpected elements,
    5 = highly creative, original content.

Also, provide a brief global comment summarizing the main strengths and weaknesses (maximum 2–3 sentences).

⚠️ Be strict and fair in your ratings; use the full range from 1 to 5 where appropriate. 

⚠️ Respond ONLY with a valid Python dictionary and nothing else.

Example format:
{
  "fluency": 4,
  "coherence": 5,
  "realism": 3,
  "fidelity_to_specification": 4,
  "engagement": 4,
  "originality": 3,
  "comments": "The dialog was fluent and engaging but lacked originality and missed some of the specification details."
}
